# Slab_SVM 
In this repository, you could find the R code for the implementation of the Slab SVM algorithm. You'll be able to find 3 main steps:
1) Definition of the objective function, inequality constraint and parameter's check.
2) Computing different NLOptR's algorithms in order to find which one is the best.
3) Optimization of the hyperparameters using mlrMBO package
